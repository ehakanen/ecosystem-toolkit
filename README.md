# ecosystem-toolkit

Welcome to Ecosystem Design! This is a simple venue for sharing the "Ecosystem Design Toolkit", a set of iterative excercises to help you plan, map and analyze networked value creation and capture. 

This toolkit contains a series of exercises to you to design your ecosystem with an open mind. It focuses on outlining the complex interlinkages among loosely-coupled actors, or ecosystem members. While the toolkit draws from the principles of platform economy and digital ecosystems, you can use the tool in any context. Moreover, using this tool may reveal that you donâ€™t need an ecosystem approach in your case!

The toolkit is based on the "Toolkit for Digital Ecosystem Design v0.1" by Ville Eloranta (CC 4.0 BY-SA), 
found at https://github.com/GMeRitS/ecosystem-Design-Toolkit/ and the original work by Simone Cicero on the "Platform Design Toolkit" (CC 4.0 BY-SA).

The repository contains PDF printouts and instructions for the v0.3 of the toolkit.
