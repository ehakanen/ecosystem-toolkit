# ecosystem-toolkit

Welcome to Ecosystem Design! This is a simple venue for sharing the "Ecosystem Design Toolkit", a set of iterative excercises to help you plan, map and analyze networked value creation and capture. 

The toolkit is based on the "Toolkit for Digital Ecosystem Design v0.1" by Ville Eloranta (CC 4.0 BY-SA), 
found at https://github.com/GMeRitS/ecosystem-Design-Toolkit/ and the original work by Simone Cicero on the "Platform Design Toolkit" (CC 4.0 BY-SA).

The repository contains PDF printouts and instructions for the v0.3 of the toolkit.
